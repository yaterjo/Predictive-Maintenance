# Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Learning

## Business Problem
In industrial settings, equipment failure can lead to significant production downtime, safety risks, and financial losses. This project aims to preemptively identify potential equipment failures, enabling proactive maintenance, reducing downtime, and optimizing operational efficiency.

## Data Insights
The project utilizes historical sensor data from industrial machinery, encompassing temperature, pressure, vibration, and other relevant parameters. This rich dataset provides a comprehensive view of the equipment's operational status over time, making it suitable for predicting potential failures.

## Data Preparation and EDA
### Preparation
- Selected numeric features relevant to equipment condition.
- Handled missing values through imputation and removal.
- Normalized features using MinMaxScaler to ensure uniformity for modeling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted time-series analysis to understand equipment behavior over time.
- Visualized correlations between different sensors to identify patterns indicative of failure modes.
- Analyzed frequency distributions of key features to pinpoint operational anomalies.

## Models
### Random Forest Classifier
- Served as a baseline model, providing initial insights into feature importance and predictive capability.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network
- Chosen for its proficiency in handling time-series data, capturing long-term dependencies in sensor readings.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Implemented EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring a balanced performance across metrics.

## Results
- The LSTM model demonstrated superior performance, achieving approximately 99.96% accuracy, with precision and recall both around 98.83%.
- Significantly reduced the potential for false negatives, critical in preventing unforeseen equipment failures.

## Recommended Next Steps
- **Validation on New Data**: Further testing on additional datasets to validate model robustness.
- **Operational Integration**: Develop an interface for real-time monitoring and alerts.
- **Model Refinement**: Explore hybrid models combining LSTM with CNNs for enhanced feature extraction.
- **Continuous Learning**: Implement a feedback loop for model retraining with new data to adapt to changing equipment behavior.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, seaborn
- Data: Access to historical sensor data from the target machinery.
